How to compile
==============================================================

To compile, you need to have several libraies installed (See
further down). To compile an application using libspotify, you
also need an application key defined in a file called appkey.c

TODO: info about obtaining application keys

After a fresh install of Ubuntu 9.04, you'll need to install 
the following packages:

libqt4-dev
build-essential
libasound-dev
libsndfile-dev (the version in the repo is too old)
libspotify (download from http://developer.spotify.com)

When the libraries and the application key are in place,
simply run:

./configure.sh
make

How to run
==============================================================

Create a file with your username and password on two separate
lines. Username first, then password. Save file as user.cfg

Then simply run:
./juniper
