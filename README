How to compile
==============================================================

To compile, you need to have several libraies installed.
You'll need qt4-dev, libspotify, libsndfile and more.
Libspotify can be downloaded from http://developer.spotify.com
To compile an application using libspotify, you also need an 
application key defined in a file called appkey.c

TODO: more about obtaining application keys
TODO: elaborate. find out what libs are needed.

When the libraries and the application key are in place,
simply run:

./configure.sh
make

How to run

Create a file with your username and password on two separate
lines. Username first, then password. Save file as user.cfg
